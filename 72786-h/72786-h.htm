<h2 class="nobreak" id="THE_LAND_OF_PROPAGANDA_IS_BUILT">THE LAND OF PROPAGANDA IS BUILT
ON UNANIMITY</h2>

</div>

<p>The quotation which follows is from Ignazio Silone’s novel,
<i>Bread and Wine</i>, which was a moving exposition of life under
Fascism in Italy. The conversation between a young woman and
an anti-Fascist priest takes place in a small Italian town at the
end of the invasion of Ethiopia by Italy. During the night, anti-war
and anti-Fascist slogans had been written on walls and steps
in the town.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Bianchina told Don Paolo she couldn’t understand why there was
such a lot of fuss about a few inscriptions on the wall.</p>

<p>Don Paolo was surprised, too. He tried to explain it.</p>

<p>“The Land of Propaganda is built on unanimity,” he said. “If one
man says, ‘No,’ the spell is broken and public order is endangered. The
rebel voice must be stifled.”</p>

<p>“Even if the voice is that of a poor, solitary sick man?”</p>

<p>“Even then.”</p>

<p>“Even if it belongs to a peaceful man who thinks in his own way,
but does nothing evil apart from that?”</p>

<p>“Even then.”</p>

<p>These thoughts served to sadden the girl, but gave the man new
heart. He felt ashamed of his previous discouragement.</p>

<p>“In the Land of Propaganda,” he said, “a man, any man, any little
man who goes on thinking with his own head, imperils public order.
Tons of printed paper repeat the government slogans; thousands of
loud-speakers, hundreds of thousands of manifestoes and leaflets,
legions of orators in the squares and at the crossroads, thousands of
priests from the pulpit repeat these slogans ad nauseam, to the point
of collective stupefaction. But it is enough for one little man to say
‘No!’ in his neighbor’s ear, or write ‘No!’ on the wall at night, and
public order is endangered.”</p>

<p>The girl was terrified, but the man was happy again.</p>

<p>“And if they catch him and kill him?” the girl asked.</p>

<p>“Killing a man who says ‘No!’ is a risky business,” the priest replied,
“because even a corpse can go on whispering ‘No! No! No!’ with a
persistence and obstinacy that only certain corpses are capable of. And
how can you silence a corpse?”</p>

<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

<p>A book which the French writer, Georges Bernanos,
wrote in Brazil—to which he had exiled himself because
he would not remain in France under Nazi occupation—has
just been published in this country. It is entitled
<i>Tradition of Freedom</i> and is a hymn to freedom, an impassioned
warning against obedience and conformity, especially
obedience to the modern State engaged in mechanized,
total war.</p>

<p>In the closing pages of this work, Bernanos writes:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>I have thought for a long time now that if, some day, the increasing
efficiency of the technique of destruction finally causes
our species to disappear from the earth, it will not be cruelty that
will be responsible for our extinction and still less, of course, the
indignation that cruelty awakens and the reprisals and vengeance
that it brings upon itself ... but the docility, the lack of responsibility
of the modern man, his base subservient acceptance of
every common decree. The horrors which we have seen, the still
greater horrors we shall presently see, are not signs that rebels,
insubordinate, untameable men, are increasing in number
throughout the world, but rather that there is a constant increase,
a stupendously rapid increase, in the number of obedient, docile
men.</p>

</div>

<p>It seems to me that this is a true and timely warning. It
might serve as a text for a general appeal to American
youth to adopt and practice the great and urgent virtues
of Holy Disobedience, non-conformity, resistance toward
Conscription, Regimentation and War. For the present I
want to use Bernanos’ words as an introduction to some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
observations on the discussion regarding the absolute and
relative role of these “virtues” which goes on chiefly among
pacifists, members of the Historic Peace Churches and other
such groups. I think it will be readily apparent, however,
that the principles set forth have a wider bearing and merit
consideration by all who are concerned about the maintenance
of freedom in our time and the abolition of war.</p>

<p>Most believers in democracy and all pacifists begin, of
course, with an area of agreement as to the moral necessity,
the validity and the possible social value of No-saying or
Holy Disobedience. Pacifists and/or conscientious objectors
all draw the line at engaging in military combat and most
of us indeed at any kind of service in the armed forces. But
immediately thereupon questions arise as to whether we
should not emphasize “positive and constructive service”
rather than the “negative” of refusal to fight or to register;
or questions about the relative importance of “resistance”
and “reconciliation,” and so on. It is to this discussion that
I wish to attempt a contribution. It may be that it will be
most useful both to young men of draft age and to other
readers if we concentrate largely on the quite concrete problem
of whether the former should register, conform to
other requirements of the Selective Service Act which apply
to conscientious objectors and accept or submit to the alternative
service required of them under the law as
amended in June, 1951; or whether they shall refuse to
register, or if they do register or are “automatically” registered
by the authorities, shall refuse to conform at the next
stage; and in any event refuse to render any alternative
service under conscription. We deal, in other words, with
the question whether young men who are eligible for it
shall accept the IV-E classification or take the more “absolutist,”
non-registrant position. (For present purposes, consideration
of the I-A-O position, the designation used for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
draftees who are willing to accept service in the armed
forces provided this is non-combatant in character, may be
omitted. The IV-E classification is the designation used for
persons who are on grounds of religious training and belief
opposed to participation in any war. Those who are given
this classification are required to render alternative service,
outside the armed forces and under civilian auspices, and
designed to serve “the health, safety and interest of the
United States.”)</p>

<p>Two preliminary observations are probably necessary in
order to avoid misunderstanding. In the first place, in every
social movement there are varied trends or emphases, and
methods of working. Those who hold to one approach are
likely to be very critical of those who take another. Disagreements
among those within the same movement may
be more intense or even bitter than with those on the outside.
I suppose it can hardly be denied that every movement
has in it individuals whose contribution is negative,
and that such individuals do not all come from within one
wing of the movement. Objective evaluation also leads to
the view that the cause is forwarded by various methods
and through the agency of diverse individuals and groups.
But this does not mean that discussion within the movement
of trends and methods of work is not useful and
essential. Even if it were true that each of several strategies
was <i>equally</i> valid and useful, it would still be necessary that
each be clearly and vigorously presented and implemented
in order that the movement might develop its maximum
impact.</p>

<p>Secondly, in what I shall have to say I am not passing
moral judgment on individual draftees. But from the fact
that a pacifist minister should not pass moral condemnation
on the young man in his congregation who in obedience to
his conscience enlists or submits to conscription, we do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span>
deduce that this minister should abandon his pacifism or
cease to witness to it. Similarly, the fact that in the pacifist
movement we support various types of COs in following
the lead of conscience does not rule out discussion as to
the validity and usefulness of various strategies. It is one
thing for a young and immature draftee to follow a course
which amounts to “making the best of a bad business” and
for others to give him sympathetic understanding and help.
It is a very different thing for pacifist organizations or
churches to advocate such a course or to rationalize it into
something other than it really is.</p>

<p>As some of the readers of this statement are likely to be
aware, the writer has advocated the non-registrant position.
The majority in the pacifist movement probably believe
that it is preferable for COs to accept or submit to the
alternative civilian service which was required under the
World War II Selective Service Act and is now again required
under “peacetime conscription.”</p>

<p>The varied considerations and arguments which currently
enter into the discussion of this choice confronting the
youth of draft age tend, as I see it, to fall into three categories,
though there is a good deal of overlapping. One set
of considerations may be said to center largely around the
idea of Christian or human “vocation”; a second set has to
do with the problem of “the immature 18-year-old”; the
third with the relation of the pacifist and citizens generally
to military conscription and the modern Power-State.</p>

<p>The argument for accepting alternative service, under the
first category, has been stated somewhat as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>God calls us to love and serve our fellowmen. This is for
Christians and other pacifists a matter of vocation. If, then, the
government in war time, or under peace time conscription, requires
some service of mercy or construction from us, which is
not obviously and directly a part of war-making, we will raise no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
objection to undertaking such work. We may even seek, and shall
certainly be grateful for the opportunity to demonstrate our desire
to be good citizens and helpful members of society, and to
show a reconciling spirit.</p>

</div>

<p>This question of the meaning and implications of Christian
or human vocation in the context of military conscription
clearly needs careful analysis.</p>

<h2>Conscription and Vocation</h2>

<p>The question of his vocation does not or should not arise
suddenly for the Christian or any morally sensitive and responsible
individual when Congress enacts a conscription
law. The committed Christian has presumably been engaged
in an occupation and a way of living which he believes
to be in accord with the will of God. This need not
be some unusual or spectacular occupation. A Christian
farmer, factory worker, miner, teacher, raising a family and
giving an example of unselfishness to his neighbors; his
wife maintaining an unobtrusively wholesome Christian
home; the children walking in the footsteps of such parents—all
these may be following a true Christian vocation.</p>

<p>Then war or peace time conscription comes along. If
these people are pacifists, they hold that direct participation
in war or in combat training is inconsistent with a
Christian profession and calling. They must, therefore, refuse
such participation. At this point the government tells
those of them who come under the draft that they must
nevertheless render some civilian service within or under
the conscription system. In most cases this will be something
different from what they have been doing and will
involve temporary removal from the home community.</p>

<p>It has for some time troubled me that a good many pacifists
of draft age seem ready to acquiesce in this situation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
and that, furthermore, many who are not directly affected
by the draft seem to feel that at such a time they must
immediately find something else to do than that which
they have been doing—something that is often referred to
as “meaningful” or “sacrificial.” Was what they were doing
then so definitely not meaningful or sacrificial? Unfortunately,
this is very likely the case in many instances. But it
does not follow, as is seemingly often assumed, that this
justifies going into some entirely new work, a “project,”
as we say, and perhaps preferably some relief work which
has some connection with the war effort, something which
society will regard as the “equivalent” of support of the
war effort. Certainly the fact that a young man of draft
age has not been following a meaningful or Christian vocation
does not automatically or by itself constitute a warrant
for submitting to conscription for so-called civilian service.
It may well be that God calls him at this juncture to put
meaning into the life he has been living and into the work
he was supposed to be doing.</p>

<p>It is certainly incumbent on us to search our hearts as to
whether this rush to get into other jobs and to go to distant
places may be motivated by fear of men and of the
authorities, by a desire to be thought well of, by a dread
of the social displeasure or actual legal punishment which
might fall upon us if we were to continue quietly at the
work which we had been doing, living in the home town
when war fever, if not outright hysteria, seizes the people.
“If I were still pleasing men,” said St. Paul, “I should not
be the slave of Christ.”</p>

<h2>The Normal as Meaningful</h2>

<p>I am convinced that our thinking in these matters is
often distorted. What God calls men and women to, fundamentally,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
is to “be fruitful and multiply and replenish the
earth and subdue it and have dominion” over the animal
creation—to sow the grain, weave the cloth, build homes
and temples to the Eternal. That is what most people
should be doing most of the time. In fact, unless they did,
even the armies would all soon have to stop in their tracks!
War comes along and breaks into this normal life of human
beings. That it does this is one of the gravest indictments
of war. To resist this breaking up of orderly family and
community life—not to yield to the subtle and insistent
pressure to do something different under the tacit assumption
that the normal cannot be meaningful—is one of the
great services the people who believe in non-violence and
reconciliation may render. “In returning and rest shall ye
be saved, in quietness and in confidence shall be your
strength.”</p>

<p>To look at the matter from another angle, it is sometimes
said that it is important that pacifists should make it
clear that they can face hardship and danger and are ready
to suffer, if need be, on behalf of their convictions. Granted
that this is true, it by no means automatically follows that
draft-age youths should submit to conscription or that other
pacifists should on the advent of war or conscription leave
what they are doing for other work. It may well be that the
most challenging opportunity to display courage, hardihood
and readiness to suffer will be found precisely in the community
in which one has been living and in trying to do
the ordinary things about which we have been speaking.
There is reason to think that some Congressmen may have
been influenced in supporting the “deferment,” or virtual
exemption, for COs under the original 1948 United States
Selective Service Act because they were convinced that few
who claim to be COs would have the nerve to stand up
against the pressure to which one would be subjected as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
tried to go his normal way in his home town or college,
when others were being drafted and forced to leave home
or college. Obviously, only a pacifist who was leading, not
a self-indulgent but a disciplined life, who was ready to
face danger and suffering and who deeply loved his fellows,
could follow such a course. It is possible that some leave
the home or college environment not because they wish to
face hardship but because they yield to the temptation to
try to avoid it.</p>

<p>Let us, after these preliminary observations, try to determine
how—from the standpoint of the concept of Christian
vocation—the pacifist may judge the action of a government
which requires so-called alternative conscript service
of him or of his children or fellow-pacifists. There are, so
far as I can see, only three possible verdicts. One possibility
is to say that the government is demanding that these conscripts
shall at least temporarily <i>abandon</i> their Christian or
true vocation for work to which they clearly are <i>not</i>
“called.” A second possibility is to say that the government
is competent in these special circumstances to determine,
and has correctly determined, that the alternative service
to which it assigns COs constitutes their Christian vocation
for the time being. The third possibility is to reason that
when the government thus forces a Christian into another
occupation, it is performing an unwarranted and sinful
act but that the Christian’s duty in such a situation is to
practice non-resistance. It, therefore, becomes his vocation
to undertake the work which is imposed upon him, not
because it is in itself somehow good but because non-resistance
to evil constitutes Christian behavior.</p>

<p>The first case is easily disposed of. If the individual is
convinced that he is being forced out of his Christian or
human vocation into something which, therefore, requires
him to disobey God or conscience, he has no alternative but<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
to refuse to comply with the State’s demand, perhaps resist
it non-violently, and take the consequences. He will still
probably be forced out of his accustomed place and work
but his non-conformity or non-cooperation with the State’s
demand at this point becomes his true vocation.</p>

<p>The second possible attitude listed a moment ago is to
hold that, in the context of conscription and provided it
does not require service in the armed forces, the State may
determine what one’s Christian vocation is. Some of the
Mennonite statements and those of some other pacifists
seem to me to fall under this head. The position seems to
me a very precarious one and I question whether Mennonites,
for example, can maintain it as consistent with
their own theology and Christian ethics.</p>

<h2>The Role of Jehovah’s Witnesses</h2>

<p>In the first place, it is essential in the Christian concept
of vocation that the “call” is from the Spirit speaking in
the heart of the believer. And the believer must always remain
in a position where he can be free to respond to the
prompting of the Spirit. But how can this be under a conscription
regime? The position of Jehovah’s Witnesses that
they cannot submit to conscription because they must always
be free to “witness” to the faith, is in this respect
surely a strong and impressive one. It has a bearing also,
incidentally, on what we said some paragraphs earlier under
general observations about Christian vocation. It seems to
me that Christian pacifists need to give much more thought
than they have done to the question whether in this particular
respect the Witnesses, so far from being eccentric,
are not taking the clear and consistent, centrally Christian,
stand. The fact that the Witnesses can hardly be classified
as pacifists in the usual sense of the term does not affect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
the relevance of this question for pacifists and indeed for
Christians generally.</p>

<p>Furthermore in Mennonite thought, government, the
State, though it is “an ordinance of God” to curb sin, is
itself by definition also sinful, not Christian, not a part of
“the order of redemption.” Where, then, does the State get
the competence, or the mandate to determine, of all things,
the <i>Christian</i> vocation of a <i>believer</i>? And particularly the
war-making arm or department of the State? If the war department
or its adjunct, Selective Service, is qualified to
determine Christian vocation as part of its conduct of, or
preparation for, a war, then why should not the labor department
in peace time tell Christians where to work?</p>

<p>There remains a third possible position, namely, that the
State is undoubtedly doing an evil thing in taking the individual
out of the work to which he feels God has called
him but that the principle of non-resistance to evil then
comes into operation and submission to this evil becomes
the vocation of the persecuted Christian. Given certain
premises, there is logic in this position, but it is nevertheless
open to serious question. In the first place, non-resistance
to an evil should not mean cooperation with it. “Depart
from evil and do good,” is the law. Pacifists in general,
and Christian pacifists in particular, have to ask whether in
conforming with any of the provisions of a draft law and
especially in rendering conscript service regarded as of
“national importance” by a war-making state, they are not
helping conscription to run smoothly, helping thus to force
conscription on millions of youth and thus in turn promoting
war, since conscription is an integral part of an
armaments race. The phenomenon of increased tension between
nations when they lengthen the compulsory service
period for youth is a familiar one. This, of course, raises
the whole question of our evaluation of the meaning and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
role of military conscription, to which we shall return later.</p>

<p>In the meantime, one or two other comments need to be
made on the phase of our problem under discussion. If
what is really happening is that the war-making state is
inflicting an evil on people, forcing them away from their
vocation, subjecting them to a measure of persecution, then
it seems we ought to keep this clearly in our own minds
and ought not to let the government or public assume that
we think otherwise. The expressions of “gratitude” which
we have sometimes heard addressed to government for
“permitting” pacifists to render alternative service seem
inappropriate. We cannot have it both ways: accuse the
State of the grave sin of invading the realm of Christian
vocation and at the same time thank it for doing us a
“favor” by making the invasion less than total. The State
is not doing God or Christian people a favor in recognizing
conscience, though that is what most United States Congressmen
think they are doing in making some provision
for COs. The pacifist who in any way encourages this notion
is in danger of helping to give currency to the idea
that conscience is a private whim which legislators may see
fit to indulge for prudential reasons, as long as those who
are afflicted with this peculiarity are very few in numbers.
If non-resistant pacifists get off the high ground of patiently
bowing the neck to Caesar’s yoke, letting Caesar inflict the
scourge of civilian conscript service upon them, they are
immediately on the low ground of bargaining for indulgence
for a small and, in that view, not too principled or
brave a minority. Standing on that lower ground they have
very little bargaining <i>power</i> and the results will reflect that
fact—and pretty much did during World War II. On the
other hand, both in Great Britain and in the United States
the sufferings which the COs endured in World War I
when there was virtually no legal or social recognition of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
them, were, according to all competent observers, largely
responsible for the fact that fairly liberal provisions for
COs were made in World War II. The Army did not want
to “be bothered with these fellows again.”</p>

<h2>Two Miles or None</h2>

<p>This does not, of course, mean that if the imposition of
alternative service is accepted, it should be rendered grudgingly
or that feelings of hostility toward government officials
with whom one may deal are appropriate. Quite the
contrary. If we decide to go with Caesar one mile, the Gospel
enjoins us to go two! We have the choice of not going
along at all or going two miles, but not a skimpy one mile.</p>

<p>I think it is now generally admitted that there was not
a great deal of this glad, spontaneous “second miling” on
the part of the conscript COs in World War II, though
there was considerable talk about it among older folks.
Civilian Public Service in large measure simply did not
operate on the high spiritual plane that was originally
hoped and is still sometimes implied or stated, but was
for many making the best of a bad business, perhaps for
lack of clear leading or the courage to follow another
course.</p>

<p>It will be recalled that there were a considerable number
of Civilian Public Service men who declared flatly that it
was inconsistent, and indeed hypocritical, to talk of spontaneous
service under conscription. “We are here,” they
said, “not because our desire to serve brought us here. We
are here because the government as part of its war program
passed a conscription law and under that law took
us by the scruff of the neck and is forcing us to do this job.
We have no choice but this or the army or jail. That fact
is bound to color this whole experience, except perhaps for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
those who can shut their eyes to reality. Any one who denies
this is a hypocrite.”</p>

<p>It seems to me these COs placed the finger on an essential
point. Compulsion does enter into “service” under a
conscription law. It affects the whole picture. Therefore,
the evaluation to be made of the IV-E position and of
alternative service under it is not disposed of by asserting
that “service is at least as real a part of Christian or pacifist
life as witness or resistance.” That statement is perfectly
correct. Service of men, fellowship with them, on the one
hand, and non-cooperation with evil, witness against injustice,
non-violent resistance, on the other hand, are both
essential in the pacifist way of life. There is some of each
in every pacifist life. The most “reconciling” one refuses to
use a gun or even, probably, to put on a uniform. Some of
the most extreme “resisters” in prison were known for the
thoughtful and gentle service they rendered to criminal
fellow-inmates. A very discerning English pacifist observed:
“For some their witness is their service, for others their
service is their witness,” or resistance. Each type needs to
be on guard against the temptations peculiar to it, including
the temptation to question the motives or underestimate
the contribution of pacifists of the other type.</p>

<p>But the service which is the essence of pacifism is free,
spontaneous, joyous, sacrificial, unbought. To magnify or
glorify this is by no means automatically to magnify or
glorify the IV-E position <i>under the draft</i>. Here, as we have
pointed out, an element enters which is contradictory to
pacifism, freedom and spontaneity—<i>the element of compulsion
in a context of war and war preparation</i>.</p>

<p>It seems to me that it is important for pacifists to bear
this in mind as we make plans to deal with the problem of
alternative service under the amended 1948 Selective Service
Act. No matter how “liberal” or “considerate” the conditions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
for administering alternative service may be in the
estimation of government officials or the pacifist agencies,
if alternative service is accepted or acquiesced in at all, it
will inevitably pose grave problems from the standpoint of
Christian vocation and it will not, I think, be possible to
escape the contamination or corruption which “conscription”
infuses into “service.” At the moment it seems possible
that Selective Service regulations will permit some
individuals to remain at their accustomed occupations. We
put aside for the time being certain questions to which we
shall return as to what the act of registration itself implies
in the context of conscription for atomic and biological war.
Here we emphasize that once a man has appealed to the
State to permit him to remain in his job and has been
granted such permission, it is not exactly the same job as
it was before. Others will not be given the same permission,
and he should not evade the question whether he can
acquiesce in and to a degree benefit from such discrimination.
He will have to consider whether the consideration
in his case arises from the fact that officials regard his work
as in some way a contribution to the war effort, or from
a desire to placate and silence an influential person. If he
should conclude that he ought to change jobs, he would
have to consult the authorities again, and what then?</p>

<p>In conferences with Selective Service officials efforts are
being made to avoid some of the features of the war-time
Civilian Public Service set-up which deeply troubled a good
many Friends—such as the close supervision by military
men allegedly functioning as civilians and the undesirable
and frustrating character of much of the work to which
IV-E men were assigned. Even if substantial concessions are
obtained, it will be well for us to be on guard against idealizing
the situation. It is hoped that a good many young
men will be in effect furloughed to projects at home and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
abroad which will not be exclusively for COs of draft age
and which will have real social value. It will not be the
same as if these men had undertaken these jobs out of a
sense of vocation and mission, apart from the context of
conscription. We know that for the most part they did not
volunteer until conscription came along. The same questions
which the man who is permitted to remain in his own
job faces, will confront these young men on projects. In addition,
their term of service and rates of pay will be set by
the government.</p>

<p>To sum up this first part of our analysis, it is my conclusion
that the one consistent attitude toward conscript
alternative service from the standpoint of Christian vocation—if
one accepts such work at all—is that which regards
submission or non-resistance to the evil which the
State imposes upon him when it interferes with his normal
occupation, as the vocation or duty of the Christian man.
Any other attitude seems to me to involve a considerable
measure of rationalization. The Mennonites came nearest
to adopting this non-resistant position and the fact that
the experience of Mennonite youths in Civilian Public
Service was less frustrating and brought better results than
was the case with others, save in exceptional instances, seems
to me to bear out my analysis. As we have pointed out,
those who non-resistantly take up their cross of conscription
should bear it joyously and be ready to carry it the
second mile.</p>

<h2>The Immature Eighteen-Year-Old</h2>

<p>We turn next to a brief consideration of the arguments
for the IV-E as against the non-registrant position which
center around the problem of “the immature 18-year-old
youth.” A number of 18-year-olds, it is pointed out, have a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span>
strong aversion to war and a leaning toward pacifism. They
are, however, emotionally immature. If they have no choice
but the army or jail all but a few will choose the army and
are likely to be lost to the pacifist cause. They could be
held and possibly even developed into a radical pacifist
position, if they had a third choice, namely, civilian service.
On the other hand, the youth who in the absence of such a
third possibility, chooses prison rather than the army may
suffer grave psychological injury.</p>

<p>I am sure no one will be disposed to be callous or “tough”
in his attitude toward any youth faced with a problem such
as we are discussing. Any one in the position of a counselor
to an individual will want to avoid “psychological
pressuring” to induce him to take this or that course, and
will strive to help the young man to make his own decision,
in accord with his own inner need and conviction, rather
than to impose a decision upon him. But I conceive that it
would be my duty as a Christian minister to have this same
attitude in talking and praying with a young man who was
going into the Army. I would have no right, nor do I think
it would do any good, to “pressure” him against his conviction
and inner need, to refuse service. But this would
certainly not mean that I give up my own pacifist convictions,
or refrain from doing all I can in general to spread
them or from making this particular young man aware of
my own thoughts and feelings. This in spite of the fact that
if young men who had planned to submit to the draft are
consequently won to the pacifist position, this may entail
considerable suffering on their part, anguish for parents
who disagree with them, and so on. It is fairly certain, incidentally,
that in many typical Southern communities—and
by no means exclusively in the South—a youth who chose
the I-A-O (medical corps) position, not to mention IV-E,
would have as tough a time as a non-registrant in many<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
metropolitan centers. We cannot, then, escape the conclusion
that as we have a responsibility to decide for the pacifist
or non-pacifist position and to bear witness for pacifism,
if that is the stand we take, so as pacifists we have a responsibility
to decide whether complete non-cooperation with
military conscription is the more consistent, committed and
effective stand or not, and if we decide for the former, then
to do what we can to make our stand and the reasons for
it known.</p>

<p>I have the impression that even a great many, perhaps
the majority, of pacifist ministers will work harder to keep
a young pacifist parishioner from taking the “absolutist”
position and going to jail rather than into civilian service,
than they would work to get the run of the mill young
parishioners to think seriously about not going into the
army. They seem somehow to feel that a more awful thing
is happening to the young CO who goes to jail than to
the 18-year-old who goes into the army. It is my impression
that this same feeling is an unconscious factor in the
thinking of many lay pacifists when they react strongly
against the idea of COs going to prison. This puzzles me
greatly. Why should they have this reaction?</p>

<h2>Army or Jail?</h2>

<p>To my mind—even apart from the sufficiently appalling
factor of being systematically trained for wholesale killing
and subjected to the risk of being killed in brutal war—there
are few if any more evil and perilous situations to put
young men into than the armed forces. I should feel much
deeper grief over having possibly had some part in getting
some youth to go into the armed forces than over having
some responsibility for bringing a young man to go to
prison for conscience’s sake. Are the qualms people feel<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
about youthful COs going to prison in certain instances
perhaps due to the fact that taking the non-registrant position
is something very unusual and regarded with social
disapproval, whereas becoming a soldier is extremely common
and meets with the highest social approval? It may be,
therefore, that there are some ministers and other older
people who should examine themselves as to whether their
feelings in the matter under discussion are due to the fact
that they themselves might find life in the community or
in the church very uncomfortable if they were suspected of
having influenced a youth to take a radical anti-draft stand,
whereas all men will speak well of them—or at least not
too ill—if they have helped, or at least not hindered, young
Christians in adjusting themselves to the idea of going into
the army. Is it just possible that we older people are sometimes
concerned with sparing ourselves when we think we
are solely concerned about sparing teen-agers?</p>

<p>To return to the 18-year-old. There are young men who
on physical and psychological grounds are exempted from
army service. There may well be COs who should on similar
grounds be exempted from any kind of service. If such
a physically or mentally ill CO is refused exemption, he
should perhaps be discouraged from undergoing the risks
of prison experience if there is an alternative for him. This
still leaves us with the problem of the majority of pacifist
and non-pacifist youth who are not ill.</p>

<p>When we find ourselves concerned about what the teen-age
religious CO who goes to prison must undergo and inclined
to think that there is here an absolutely conclusive
case for providing alternative service and urging most such
COs to avail themselves of it, we might first take a look at
two other categories of youth who are subject to the draft.
One of them consists of those actually drafted into the
armed services; the other of the so-called non-religious COs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span></p>

<p>The great mass of teen-agers are going to be put through
rigorous military training with all the hardships, the toughening
and the temptations which this entails. They have to
be ready to undergo actual battle experience. Many of them
will actually experience modern war at the front. Is what
the CO undergoes in prison vastly more terrible than this?
Is it as terrible? It may be said that the soldier has social
approbation whereas the pacifist, especially the “absolutist”
meets social disapprobation and even ostracism. This is indeed
a sore trial and many cannot endure it. Frankly, I am
still left with more grief and pity in my heart for the teen-age
soldier than for the teen-age “absolutist” CO. I am still
left with a question whether we have a right to take any
time and energy away from the struggle to lift the curse of
conscription from the mass of youth and put it into an
effort to secure alternative conscript service for COs.</p>

<p>There are, as we know, teen-age “absolutists” who feel the
same way and who have demonstrated that they can endure
whatever they may be called upon to endure. Nor is their
lot without its compensations. They, also, “have their reward.”</p>

<h2>The So-Called Non-Religious CO</h2>

<p>Religious COs who accept the IV-E classification and
older pacifists who advocate this course have also to consider
the non-religious CO. Under United States Law it is
the so-called religious CO who is eligible for this classification;
the so-called non-religious CO, though he may by
unanimous consent be equally sincere, is not. The latter
has no choice except the army or jail. The fact that he is
only 18 years old does not alter that. Nothing in this entire
field of pacifist policy and behavior is, frankly, harder for
me to understand than how religious COs and many of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
leaders of the peace churches and of the Fellowship of Reconciliation,
can acquiesce in this situation and accept what
is regarded as an advantage, a preferred position, under it.
The white CO who accepted conscript alternative service
when the Negro CO was automatically forced to choose the
army or prison would be in an invidious position. So would
the Gentile when his Jewish comrade was thus discriminated
against. But in my mind the case is far more deplorable
when it is the religious and the supposedly non-religious
man who are involved. The white man or the
Gentile might actually believe in discrimination or not
regard it too seriously when the discrimination is in his
favor. But for the religious man it should surely be a central
and indispensable part of his faith that discrimination,
most of all where two men acting in obedience to conscience
are involved, is unthinkable and that if there is discrimination,
he cannot be the beneficiary of it.</p>

<p>At any rate, the argument that there must be alternative
service because <i>immature</i> 18-year-olds must by no means be
subjected to prison experience seems to me to become completely
impotent in the mouths of those religious pacifists
who acquiesce in the arrangement under discussion and
enable it to work—unless indeed they mean to contend
that the average religious CO has less stamina than the
non-religious CO and that, therefore, the former should
be given gentler treatment.</p>

<p>Advocacy of alternative service for the teen-age CO is
based on considerations relating to the future of the pacifist
movement, as well as on the effect on the COs themselves.
It is argued that if the only choice young pacifists have is
the army or jail, there will be very few pacifists. This argument
was not, however, first advanced when the draft age
was lowered. It was often heard during World War II when
most COs were older and more seasoned. It has always impressed<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
me as a dubious argument and I wonder where it
leads us. What, for example, is the relationship of this argument
to the one which is also advanced—sometimes by the
same person—that the IV-E position is very meaningful and
perhaps to be preferred to the more “absolutist” one, because
it is the IV-E man who gives a glorious demonstration
of the spirit of selfless service which is the essence of pacifism
at its best? These two concepts cannot very well be
harnessed together as a team. We can hardly contend in
one and the same breath that we want alternative service
because most young pacifists are not ready to follow a
stronger and more sacrificial course <i>and</i> that we want it
because it is the strongest and most meaningful course
pacifists can follow. It seems to me we have to decide
whether our problem is to find shelter for COs or whether
it is to find freedom and the opportunity for self-expression
and service, even though the price be high.</p>

<p>To consider the matter for a moment from the tactical
viewpoint, it seems quite certain that the number of 18-year-olds
who take either the IV-E or the non-registrant
position (perhaps even the I-A-O position might be included)
will at least at the outset be small. The draft now
gets the young man at the very age when it is most difficult
for him to stand out in any way from the mass of his fellows.
Even if he is intellectually pretty well convinced of
the pacifist position, he is not emotionally mature enough
to take it. It is a fair guess that the accessions to the pacifist
movement, if military service and/or training becomes universal,
will in the future come mainly from young people
who have gone through the experience of life in the armed
forces. In other words, the additional number of pacifists
recruited because alternative service is provided may turn
out to be very small. If so, the numerical advantage from
the adoption of a less uncompromising pacifism is illusory.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span></p>

<p>There is one other factor which may be mentioned in
this context, that we live in an age when the role of minorities
is an increasingly difficult one. The pressures and the
actual persecution to which they are subjected are severe.
The trend is still partially obscured in the United States
but if we pause to reflect that not a single bomb has as
yet fallen on this country, we shall realize that this country
is not an exception to the trend toward greater conformity
and regimentation. As the New York <i>Times</i> editorialized
some time ago in commenting on some features
of the McCarran Act, if we are already resorting to such
repressive measures, what will we do when a real crisis
comes? In other words, while we spend a good deal of time
arguing that COs should have some choice other than the
army or jail, we are probably moving into a time when
that will essentially be the only choice that members of
minorities, including pacifists, have. It would seem then
that our thought and energy should be devoted to two
issues: whether and how this trend toward totalitarianism
can be halted and how we may prepare and discipline ourselves
to meet the tests which our fellow-pacifists in some
other lands have already had to meet?</p>

<h2>The Nature of Conscription</h2>

<p>This, however, leads to the third and last of the issues we
are trying to explore: the true nature of conscription, of
modern war, and of the conscripting, war-making State—and
the attitude which pacifists consequently should take
toward them.</p>

<p>Participation in alternative service is quite often defended
on the ground that our opposition is to war rather
than conscription; except in the matter of war we are as
ready to serve the nation as anybody; therefore, as long as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
we are not drafted for combat or forced against our will
into the armed services, we are ready to render whatever
service of a civilian character may be imposed upon us.</p>

<p>Is this a sound position? Let me emphasize that it is
conscription for war under the conditions of the second half
of the twentieth century that we are talking about. The
question as to whether sometime and under some circumstances
we might accept conscription for some conceivable
purpose not related to war, is not here at stake. It is academic
and irrelevant. The question with which we are
dealing is that of conscripting youth in and for modern
war.</p>

<p>As pacifists we are opposed to all war. Even if recruitment
were entirely on a voluntary basis, we would be opposed.
It seems to me we might infer from this that we
should be <i>a fortiori</i> opposed to military conscription, for
here in addition to the factor of war itself, the element of
coercion by government enters in, coercion which places
young boys in a military regime where they are deprived
of freedom of choice in virtually all essential matters. They
may not have the slightest interest in the war, yet they are
made to kill by order. This is surely a fundamental violation
of the human spirit which must cause the pacifist to
shudder.</p>

<p>The reply is sometimes made that pacifists are <i>not</i> being
conscripted for military purposes and therefore—presumably—<i>they</i>
are not faced with the issue of the nature of
military conscription. I shall later contend that it is not
really possible to separate conscription and war, as I think
this argument does. Here I wish to suggest that even if the
question is the conscription of non-pacifist youth, it is a
fundamental mistake for pacifists ever to relent in their
opposition to this evil, ever to devote their energies primarily
to securing provisions for COs in a draft law or to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
lapse into a feeling that conscription has somehow become
more palatable if such provisions are made by the State.
It is not our own children if we are pacifist parents, our
fellow-pacifist Christians if we are churchmen, about whom
we should be most deeply concerned. In the first place, that
is a narrow and perhaps self-centered attitude. In the second
place, pacifist youths have some inner resources for
meeting the issue under discussion. The terrible thing which
we should never lose sight of, to which we should never reconcile
our spirits, is that the great mass of 18-year-olds are
drafted for war. They are given no choice. Few are at the
stage of development where they are capable of making fully
rational and responsible choice. Thus the fathers immolate
the sons, the older generation immolates the younger, on
the altar of Moloch. What God centuries ago forbade Abraham
to do even to his own son—“Lay not thy hand upon
the lad, neither do thou anything unto him”—this we do
by decree to the entire youth of a nation.</p>

<p>We need to ask ourselves whether such conscription is in
any real sense a lesser evil. As we have already said, the
pacifist is opposed to war and we have all sensed the danger
of arguing against conscription <i>on the ground that</i> the
nation could raise all the troops it needed by voluntary
enlistment. Nevertheless, there is a point to an impassioned
argument which George Bernanos makes in the book we
mentioned at the outset. He states that the man created
by western or Christian civilization “disappeared in the
day conscription became law ... the principle is a totalitarian
principle if ever there was one—so much so that you
could deduce the whole system from it, as you can deduce
the whole of geometry from the propositions of Euclid.”</p>

<p>To the question as to whether France, the Fatherland,
should not be defended if in peril, he has the Fatherland
answer: “I very much doubt whether my salvation requires<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
such monstrous behavior” as defense by modern war methods.
If men wanted to die on behalf of the Fatherland,
moreover, that would be one thing but “making a clean
sweep, with one scoop of the hand, of an entire male population”
is another matter altogether: “You tell me that,
in saving me, they save themselves. Yes, if they can remain
free; no, if they allow you to destroy, by this unheard of
measure, the national covenant. For as soon as you have,
by simple decree, created millions of French soldiers, it will
be held as proven that you have sovereign rights over the
persons and the goods of every Frenchman, that there are
no rights higher than yours and where, then, will your
usurpations stop? Won’t you presently presume to decide
what is just and what is unjust, what is Evil and what is
Good?”</p>

<p>It is pretty certainly an oversimplification to suggest, as
Bernanos here does, that the entire totalitarian, mechanized
“system” under which men today live or into which they
are increasingly drawn even in countries where a semblance
of freedom and spontaneity remains, can be traced to its
source in the military conscription which was instituted by
the French Revolution in the eighteenth century. But what
cannot, it seems to me, be successfully denied is that today
totalitarianism, depersonalization, conscription, war, and
the conscripting, war-making power-state are inextricably
linked together. They constitute a whole, a “system.” It is a
disease, a creeping paralysis, which affects all nations, on
both sides of the global conflict. Revolution and counter-revolution,
“peoples’ democracies” and “western democracies,”
the “peace-loving” nations on both sides in the war,
are cast in this mold of conformity, mechanization and violence.
This is the Beast which, in the language of the
Apocalypse, is seeking to usurp the place of the Lamb.</p>

<p>We know that “war will stop at nothing” and we are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
clear that as pacifists we can have nothing to do with it.
But I do not think that it is possible to distinguish between
war and conscription, to say that the former is and
the latter is not an instrument or mark of the Beast.</p>

<h2>Disobedience Becomes Imperative</h2>

<p>Non-conformity, Holy Disobedience, becomes a virtue
and indeed a necessary and indispensable measure of spiritual
self-preservation, in a day when the impulse to conform,
to acquiesce, to go along, is the instrument which is
used to subject men to totalitarian rule and involve them
in permanent war. To create the impression at least of outward
unanimity, the impression that there is no “real” opposition,
is something for which all dictators and military
leaders strive assiduously. The more it seems that there is
no opposition, the less worthwhile it seems to an ever larger
number of people to cherish even the thought of opposition.
Surely, in such a situation it is important not to place
the pinch of incense before Caesar’s image, not to make the
gesture of conformity which is involved, let us say, in registering
under a military conscription law. When the object
is so plainly to create a situation where the individual no
longer has a choice except total conformity or else the concentration
camp or death; when reliable people tell us
seriously that experiments are being conducted with drugs
which will paralyze the wills of opponents within a nation
or in an enemy country, it is surely neither right nor wise
to wait until the “system” has driven us into a corner where
we cannot retain a vestige of self-respect unless we say No.
It does not seem wise or right to wait until this evil catches
up with us, but rather to go out to meet it—to <i>resist</i>—before
it has gone any further.</p>

<p>As Bernanos reminds us, “things are moving fast, dear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
reader, they are moving very fast.” He recalls that he
“lived at a time when passport formalities seemed to have
vanished forever.” A man could “travel around the world
with nothing in his wallet but his visiting card.” He recalls
that “twenty years ago, Frenchmen of the middle class refused
to have their fingerprints taken; fingerprints were the
concern of convicts.” But the word “criminal” has “swollen
to such prodigious proportions that it now includes every
citizen who dislikes the Regime, the System, the Party, or
the man who represents them.... The moment, perhaps,
is not far off when it will seem natural for us to leave the
front-door key in the lock at night so that the police may
enter at any hour of the day or night, <i>as it is to open our
pocket-books to every official demand</i>. And when the State
decides that it would be a practical measure ... to put
some outward sign on us, why should we hesitate to have
ourselves branded on the cheek or on the buttock, with a
hot iron, like cattle? The purges of ‘wrong-thinkers,’ so
dear to the totalitarian regimes, would thus become infinitely
easier.”</p>

<p>To me it seems that submitting to conscription even for
civilian service is permitting oneself thus to be branded by
the State. It makes the work of the State in preparing for
war and in securing the desired impression of unanimity
much easier. It seems, therefore, that pacifists should refuse
to be thus branded.</p>

<p>In the introductory chapter to Kay Boyle’s volume of
short stories about occupied Germany, <i>The Smoking Mountain</i>,
there is an episode which seems to me to emphasize
the need of Resistance and of not waiting until it is indeed
too late. She tells about a woman, professor of philology in
a Hessian university who said of the German experience
with Nazism: “It was a gradual process.” When the first
<i>Jews Not Wanted</i> signs went up, “there was never any protest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
made about them, and, after a few months, not only
we, but even the Jews who lived in that town, walked past
without noticing any more that they were there. Does it
seem impossible to you that this should have happened to
civilized people anywhere?”</p>

<p>The philology professor went on to say that after a while
she put up a picture of Hitler in her class-room. After twice
refusing to take the oath of allegiance to Hitler, she was
persuaded by her students to take it. “They argued that in
taking this oath, which so many anti-Nazis had taken before
me, <i>I was committing myself to nothing, and that I
could exert more influence as a professor than as an outcast
in the town</i>.”</p>

<p>She concluded by saying that she now had a picture of a
Jew, Spinoza, where Hitler’s picture used to hang, and
added: “Perhaps you will think that I did this ten years
too late, and perhaps you are right in thinking this. <i>Perhaps
there was something else we could all of us have done, but
we never seemed to find a way to do it, either as individuals
or as a group, we never seemed to find a way.</i>” A decision
by the pacifist movement in this country to break completely
with conscription, to give up the idea that we can
“exert more influence” if we conform in some measure, do
not resist to the uttermost—this might awaken our countrymen
to a realization of the precipice on the edge of which
we stand. It might be the making of our movement.</p>

<h2>The Reconciling Resistance</h2>

<p>Thus to embrace Holy Disobedience is not to substitute
Resistance for Reconciliation. It is to practice both Reconciliation
and Resistance. In so far as we help to build up
or smooth the way for American militarism and the regimentation
which accompanies it, we are certainly not practising<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
reconciliation toward the millions of people in the
Communist bloc countries against whom American war
preparations, including conscription, are directed. Nor are
we practising reconciliation toward the hundreds of millions
in Asia and Africa whom we condemn to poverty and
drive into the arms of Communism by our addiction to
military “defense.” Nor are we practising love toward our
own fellow-citizens, including also the multitude of youths
in the armed services, if, against our deepest insight, we
help to fasten the chains of conscription and war upon
them.</p>

<p>Our works of mercy, healing and reconstruction will have
a deeper and more genuinely reconciling effect when they
are not entangled with conscript service for “the health,
safety and interest” of the United States or any other war-making
State. It is highly doubtful whether Christian mission
boards can permit any of their projects in the Orient
to be manned by men supposed to be working for “the
health, safety and interest” of the United States. The Gospel
of reconciliation will be preached with a new freedom
and power when the preachers have broken decisively with
American militarism. It can surely not be preached at all
in Communist lands by those who have not made that
break. It will be when we have gotten off the back of what
someone has called the wild elephant of militarism and
conscription on to the solid ground of freedom, and only
then, that we shall be able to live and work constructively.
Like Abraham we shall have to depart from the City-which-is
in order that we may help to build the City-which-is-to-be,
whose true builder and maker is God.</p>

<p>It is, of course, possible, perhaps even likely, that if we
set ourselves apart as those who will have no dealings whatever
with conscription, will not place the pinch of incense
before Caesar’s image, our fellow-citizens will stone us, as<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
Stephen was stoned when he reminded his people that it
was they who had “received the law as it was ordained by
angels, and kept it not.” So may we be stoned for reminding
our people of a tradition of freedom and peace which
was also, in a real sense, “ordained by angels” and which
we no longer keep. But, it will thus become possible for
them, as for Paul, even amidst the search for new victims
to persecute, suddenly to see again the face of Christ and
the vision of a new Jerusalem.</p>

<p>Some one may at this point reflect that earlier in this
paper I counseled against people too readily leaving the
normal path of life and that I am now counseling a policy
which is certain to create disturbance in individual lives,
families and communities. That is so. But to depart from
the common way in response or reaction to a conscription
law, in the attempt to adapt oneself to an abnormal state
of society, is one thing. To leave father, mother, wife, child,
yea and one’s own life also, at the behest of Christ or conscience
is quite another. Our generation will not return
to a condition under which every man may sit under his
own vine and fig tree, with none to make him afraid, unless
there are those who are willing to pay the high cost of redemption
and deliverance from a regime of regimentation,
terror and war.</p>

<p>Finally, it is of crucial importance that we should understand
that for the individual to pit himself in Holy Disobedience
against the war-making and conscripting State,
wherever it or he be located, is not an act of despair or
defeatism. Rather, I think we may say that precisely this
individual refusal to “go along” is now the beginning and
the core of any realistic and practical movement against war
and for a more peaceful and brotherly world. For it becomes
daily clearer that political and military leaders pay
virtually no attention to protests against current foreign<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
policy and pleas for peace when they know perfectly well
that when it comes to a showdown, all but a handful of
the millions of protesters will “go along” with the war to
which the policy leads. All but a handful will submit to
conscription. Few of the protesters will so much as risk
their jobs in the cause of “peace.” The failure of the policymakers
to change their course does not, save perhaps in
very rare instances, mean that they are evil men who want
war. They feel, as indeed they so often declare in crucial
moments, that the issues are so complicated, the forces arrayed
against them so strong, that they “have no choice”
but to add another score of billions to the military budget,
and so on and on. Why should they think there is any
reality, hope or salvation in “peace advocates” who when
the moment of decision comes also act on the assumption
that they “have no choice” but to conform?</p>

<p>Precisely in a day when the individual appears to be
utterly helpless, to “have no choice,” when the aim of the
“system” is to convince him that he is helpless as an individual
and that the only way to meet regimentation is by
regimentation, there is absolutely no hope save in going
back to the beginning. The human being, the child of God,
must assert his humanity and his sonship again. He must
exercise the choice which he no longer has as something
accorded him by society, which he “naked, weaponless,
armourless, without shield or spear, but only with naked
